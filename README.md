# Rate My Dog

### A ruby-on-rails backend, react front end review app.

The goal of this project is to explore setting up an api with rails and an integrated interface using React state and hooks to store the requested information.

### Setup

Until the front end is fully completed, I won't be hosting the project. If you wish to demo it as it stands, follow the below instructions:

- Clone the repo
- Run bundle install
- Run the following commands to create the database:
```
rails db:create
rails db:migrate
rails db:seed
```
- Boot up the server using
```
rails s
```
- Navigate to http://localhost:3000
- Enjoy!
